## Reporting a Vulnerability

When you discover a vulnerability, immediately create an issue and cite the specific vulnerability. Make sure the issue is 
titled << [VULNERABILITY][URGENT] "Brief summary" >>

Then go and report it into discussions and admins (mostly me, the creator atm) will get onto it as soon as we are available. 
We will then report that version as vulnerable or unsupported depending on the severity of the vulnerability.
